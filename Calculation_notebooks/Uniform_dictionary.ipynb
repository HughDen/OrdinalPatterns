    "The brute force method alluded to before Proposition 5.21 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07172) iterates over all addresses for alcoves such that the basis coordinates of points in the alcoves have values in $[0,1]$ and are required to be zero for certain simple roots. This page contains an even more brute force approach that iterates over addresses that have values of $0$ or $-1$ on simple roots and computes which permutation has an inversion set corresponding to the negative values of the address.

    "There are $(n-1)!$ alcoves in $[0,1]^n$. One approach to generating these is to take an address of an alcove in $[0,1]^{n-1}$, append the minimum possible entries to form an address of an alcove in $[0,1]^n$, and then search for the next valid increment that satisfies the constraints of Shi's Theorem. There may be a nice way to do this, but transitioning from $[0,1]^{n-1}$ alcoves to $[0,1]^n$ alcoves appears to require a cubic in $n$ search if it is done naively. (One must produce $n-1$ increments per alcove from $[0,1]^{n-1}$, then each Shi constraint involves checking up to $n-1$ constraints, and the search for a valid increment involves up to $n-1$ Shi constraint searches.)\n",

    "Instead of this straightforward approach, we use a construction due to Stanley in [Eulerian partitions of a hypercube](http://math.mit.edu/~rstan/pubs/pubfiles/34a.pdf). Associated to each permutation is an alcove whose address is given by a minor modification to the construction. Thus, we iterate over all $(n-1)!$ permutations and produce the assocated alcoves in $[0,1]^n$. This process appears to be quadratic in $n$ per alcove and is the fastest method I've found thus far."
