    "In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07172), we show that in a random symmetric walk, the ordinal pattern probability of an almost consecutive permutation does not depend upon choice of symmetric density function. (Almost consecutive permutations are defined in the paper as those whose consecutive values are at most two positions apart in the $1$-line notation.) This notebook adds all of these probabilities for various $n$. The result is a Bernoulli trial that works for a large class of density functions."
